Super simple Go file server with upload and basic authentication.

This is a pet project to play with go, use at your own risk...

Run `./gen-cert`

```
Usage: ./server
  -h string
        interface to serve on (default "0.0.0.0")
  -k    don't use TLS
  -p string
        port to serve on (default "8000")
  -u string
        user:pass for basic auth
```
